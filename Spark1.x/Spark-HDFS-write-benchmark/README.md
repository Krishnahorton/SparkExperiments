# Spark Benchmark Tool

This tool is inspired by the TestDFSIO benchmark tool for Hadoop mapreduce. This tool will use the Spark framework for writing to HDFS. 

## Disclaimer

Lies, damn lies and benchmarks. Goal of this project is providing a somewhat usefull sanity check of your Spark setup, focusing on the HDFS writing performance, not on the compute performance. 

## Getting the Spark Jar
Clone and build 

mvn clean package

It's build for HDP 2.6.5.0 ( 1.6.3.2.6.5.0-292 )/ Scala 2.10.5

## Submit args explained:

`<file/partitions>` : should ideally be equal to recommended spark.default.parallelism (cores x instances).

`<bytes_per_file>` : should fit in memory: for example: 90000000.

`<write_repetitions>` : no of re-writing of the test RDD to disk. benchmark will be averaged.

```sh
spark-submit --class org.ward.Benchmark  --master yarn --deploy-mode cluster --num-executors X --executor-cores Y --executor-memory Z benchmark-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <files/partitions> <bytes_per_file> <write_repetitions>
```

## CLI Example for 12 workers with 30GB mem per node:

This command will write out the generated RDD 10 times, and will calculate an aggregate throughput over it.

```sh
spark-submit --class org.ward.Benchmark  --master yarn --deploy-mode cluster --num-executors 60 --executor-cores 3 --executor-memory 4G benchmark-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 180 90000000 10
```

## Retrieving benchmark results:

Retrieve the benchmark results by running:

```sh
yarn logs -applicationId <application_id> | grep 'Benchmark' 
```

for example:    

```
Benchmark: Total volume         : 81000000000 Bytes
Benchmark: Total write time     : 74.979 s
Benchmark: Aggregate Throughput : 1.08030246E9 Bytes per second
```
